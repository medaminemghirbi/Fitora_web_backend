# Shared by User (admin/staff — never superadmin) and Client.
#
# For an admin it is a gate: a gym opening its own account confirms the
# address before anything past sign-up opens (see
# Api::V1::BaseController#require_confirmed_email!), so the trial never
# starts on a mistyped address nobody reads. For staff and members — whose
# addresses the gym typed in — it stays informational: it lets the frontend
# show "confirm your email" and lets us trust the address for things like
# the password-reset flow itself.
